# 📚 Learning Log – TaskFlow360 (Frontend)

This document summarizes my learning journey while building the React + .NET Core based task manager project as part of my upskilling initiative from February 2024 to April 2025.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build and showcase a complete full-stack application using **React + TypeScript frontend** with a **.NET 8 Web API backend**, demonstrating:
- Frontend modularization and component architecture
- Backend clean architecture, CQRS, MediatR, and repository patterns
- End-to-end integration using REST and Axios
- Deployment-ready folder structure and clean GitHub documentation

---

## 🧠 Learning Timeline (Feb 2024 – Apr 2025)

| Phase | Key Activities |
|-------|----------------|
| **Planning & Stack Selection** | Identified current industry trends; selected React, TypeScript, .NET 8, and Azure Functions |
| **Backend Setup** | Created `TaskFlow360` API using Clean Architecture, CQRS with MediatR, and in-memory repository |
| **Frontend Bootstrapping** | Set up React app using Vite + TypeScript; installed core dev tools and VS Code extensions |
| **React Fundamentals** | Practiced `useState`, `useEffect`, props, events, component composition, and state management |
| **Componentization** | Created reusable components: `TaskForm`, `TaskCard`; implemented form handling and task list |
| **API Integration** | Integrated with backend using Axios, implemented CRUD with `getTasks`, `addTask`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask` |
| **CORS & Environment Fixes** | Resolved CORS issues by updating backend configuration and protocol mismatches |
| **Styling & UX Polish** | Applied inline styles, added spacing, card UI, and completed toggle functionality |
| **Final GitHub Push** | Created `README.md` and `LEARNING_LOG.md`, added comments to all files, and pushed to GitHub for portfolio |

## 🧩 Key Concepts Learned

- Functional React architecture and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Controlled components and prop drilling
- Axios-based API integration
- Reusable UI components with props and styles
- Clean, readable GitHub repo setup with separation of concerns

## 📝 Notes for Reviewers

While the GitHub commits were pushed in a short span for consistency, the project reflects a structured learning and development effort spread across 2–3 months.

This log is maintained to ensure **transparency**, showcase **accountability**, and provide recruiters with insights into the **depth and timeline** of upskilling efforts.
